# Heart-Disease-Project-ML-Classification
(The is a follow-along tutorial project done in the course "Complete AI & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp" by Andrei N. & Daniel B.")

This Jupyter notebook looks into using various Python-based ML & DS libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
It introduces some foundation ML and DS concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease "classification" problem using "Structured Data".

Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (single-class classification). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as "multi-class classification".
